# OS_Refresher_0.2

This exercise is aimed to serve two objectives – writing assembly language programs and secondly to help combine a C program with and assembly languge
function.

We need to do the following:

1. Write a program that takes two integers as user inputs. Lets call it prog-add.c.

2. The program calls a function add, that is written in assembly languge (x86-64). The program takes two arguments from the stack – viz. the two integers that are passed from the main() function of prog-add.c.

3. The add function takes two integer arguments, add them and returns them. The main function of prog-add.c should print this sum (that has been computed by the add function.
